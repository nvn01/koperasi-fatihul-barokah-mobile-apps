# Mobile Koperasi Syariah Application - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

The Mobile Koperasi Syariah application is a digital solution for KSPPS BMT Fatihul Barokah Gandaria to provide members with self-service access to their financial information. This React Native mobile application aims to modernize the existing cooperative's operations while working within the constraints of their current system.

## Business Context

- The cooperative has been operating since 2019 with proper licensing
- Currently using a purchased system (Rp 16 million) that lacks mobile capabilities
- Members must physically visit the office to check balances and transaction history
- Transaction recording is semi-manual with potential for data discrepancies
- Financial records close daily at 3 PM, with later transactions processed the next day

## Key Challenges

1. **Limited Digital Access**: Members have no online method to check balances or transaction history
2. **Manual Administrative Processes**: Loan applications require paper forms and physical presence
3. **Limited Payment Options**: No digital payment integration for installments
4. **Data Synchronization**: Main system cannot be directly accessed; only daily exports at 3 PM
5. **Security Implementation**: Need to implement proper authentication while maintaining user convenience

## Application Goals

1. Provide members with convenient access to their financial information
2. Streamline loan application processes
3. Implement notification systems for payment reminders
4. Create a digital platform that works with the constraints of the existing system
5. Improve overall member experience through digital transformation
6. Facilitate new customer registration process with digital forms
7. Provide administrative tools for monitoring and managing the application

## User Flows

### Registration Process

1. **Splash Screen**: Initial loading screen with logo and illustration (3 seconds)
2. **Introduction**: Continue button leading to phone number entry
3. **Phone Verification**:
      - Enter phone number

      - Receive and enter verification code (retryable after 1 minute if not received)
4. **Account Validation**:
      - Enter full name exactly as registered with the cooperative
      - Enter account number for validation against the main system data
      - System validates against imported data (updated daily at 3 PM)
      - **New:** "Daftar Rekening BMT Fatihul Barokah" button for new customers without an account in input nomor rekening page
5. **Security Setup**:
      - Create 6-digit security PIN
      - Confirm 6-digit security PIN
6. **Registration Completion**:
      - Account creation success message
      - Redirect to dashboard

- Queue actions performed offline for sync when connectivity returns
- Clear indicators of offline mode and data freshness

### Security Best Practices

- No sensitive data stored in client-side storage
- Regular security audits of codebase
- Certificate pinning for API communication
- Implement app timeout after period of inactivity
